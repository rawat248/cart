# **MEDICINE App**

A medicine app using React, Redux, and React Hooks would likely be a web-based application that allows users to browse and search for different types of medicine. The app would use React for building the user interface, Redux for managing the application's state, and React Hooks for handling state and side effects. The filter method would likely be used to allow users to search for specific types of medicine .The app would likely include features such as displaying information about different types of medicine, allowing users to add items to a shopping cart, and providing a way for users to make purchase.
